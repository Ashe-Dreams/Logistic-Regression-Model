# Logistic-Regression-Model
An optimal classification model on CreditCards.
We want to investigate what factors/variables affect the possibility of Good/Bad Credit.
And Make predictions whether a customer should get its loan approved or not based on the features given on the raw dataset.
Hence our Dependent variable (y) is the CreditCard Approval (Yes/No) or if the CreditCard authorization is considered Good/Bad.
